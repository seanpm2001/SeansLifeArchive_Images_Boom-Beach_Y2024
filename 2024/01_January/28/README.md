I watched a recent battle replay, I feel that ranged attacks are really unfair, because there are only 5 buildings in my base that can target these troops (3 rocket launchers and a shock launcher) and they hardly do any damage to tanks.

I did it 3 times, as stone is becoming very evident to be one of the most difficult resources to get in this game, and it is making it impossible to upgrade anything on a weekly basis. This week was easy due to this, and I upgraded a boom cannon to level 12. I plan to upgrade all my boom cannons to level 12, then to level 13, and whatever else level I can get them to with my current headquarters level. Additionally, I upgraded my Grenadier to level 6 for 5.9 million gold, which is the last upgrade I can currently do with the armory level I have. Gold will then be useless again.

I additionally plan to upgrade all my boom cannons to level 12, then to level 13, and whatever else level I can get them to with my current headquarters level.

<!-- Notes 2023.02.12
scorcher upgrade available, I didn't know I would unlock so many by just 1 armory upgrade
Scorcher is my toughest troop, having more hitpoints in 1 unit than any building (excluding the headquarters) in my base, it is like having 8 portable headquarters buildings that can defend themselves. My scorcher (unboosted) has close to 40000 hp. I could have a level 1 cannon target it for the entire duration of a battle, and it wouldn't die from it. Someday, I am hoping the same can be said, but for a level 1 boom cannon

My headquarters finished upgrading to level 21. It looks so much better now. The level 22 headquarters looks even more epic, but I am not going to rush my base that much to upgrade it right now.

I continued power stone conversion again this week. I began building 3 shock mines, along with a new boom cannon.

Stone has become very evident to be one of the most difficult resources to get in this game, and it is making it impossible to upgrade anything on a weekly basis. This week was easier, as the new low level building unlocked from upgrading my headquarters to level 21 isn't going to be expensive to upgrade for a few weeks. I also have another upgrade in mind: getting one of my machine guns to the highest level possible. I have noted that a max level machine gun can actually widdle down the health of my scorchers pretty quickly, and the level 20 and beyond machine guns look really cool as well. I additionally plan to upgrade all my boom cannons to level 12, then to level 13, and whatever else level I can get them to with my current headquarters level. Now that I have a level 21 headquarters, I can upgrade my machine guns to level 21.

I did a submarine dive. Afterwards, I quit. - 2023, Sunday, August 6th

### 2023, Sunday, August 13th

I had a short session today. The game did not require an update today, and was annoying to operate due to bugging me about updates, and proto troops I don't care for. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops until stage 5, where I lost 4 scorchers.

I continued power stone conversion again this week. I began to upgrade a boom cannon to level 2 today.

### 2023, Sunday, August 20th

I had a longer session today. The game did not require an update today, and wasn't as annoying about updates as last week, because it didn't pop up for as long, and there were no proto-troop offers. I attacked the first 6 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops until stage 6, where I lost all 8 scorchers, and also the battle.

I continued power stone conversion again this week. 

Stone has become very evident to be one of the most difficult resources to get in this game, and it is making it impossible to upgrade anything on a weekly basis. I began to try and go for a level 21 machine gun today. I opened several trader crates, but it didn't give enough stone. I didn't want to wait any longer, so I went ahead and spent 348 diamonds on 606,128 stone. I can make these diamonds back in about 1-2 months, and they can't go towards anything else anyways.

I also began to upgrade my Medic to level 9 for 5.3 million gold.

### 2023, Sunday, August 27th

I had a longer session today. The game did not require an update today. I attacked the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops until stage 4, where I lost 1 scorcher. I usually don't lose troops on this stage nowadays, so this was rare.

I continued power stone conversion again this week. 

Stone has become very evident to be one of the most difficult resources to get in this game, and it is making it impossible to upgrade anything on a weekly basis. My top machine gun is now level 21, but the level 22 one looks even better. I will not rush my base for it though. This week, I upgraded a boom cannon to level 3, as I couldn't afford any other upgrades.

The Tribal Mega Crab event was active this week, and I made it to stage 14 with 7 out of 8 scorchers.

My top machine gun is now level 21, but the level 22 one looks even better. I will not rush my base for it though. This week, the trader offered a very large amount of stone for only a few million gold. I was wanting to do an upgrade in my armory or to Dr. Kavan, and felt slightly bad about not doing so, but this stone is so much more important. I was able to upgrade a second boom cannon to level 14 today because of it. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough stone to do the level 15 boom cannon upgrade.

This week, I was scammed out of 3 trades, as the gold for stone trade was offered to me too early, and I missed out on nearly 4 million stone, as I didn't have enough gold stockpiled. I was still able to upgrade a cannon to level 18 today, but I was disappointed with my luck with the trader.

I began to upgrade a regular cannon to level 17 today. This upgrade wouldn't have been possible without the Halloween Mega Crab event today. I regret upgrading my warrior troop to level 17 last week, as I missed out on 2 stone trades due to this.

I had a much longer session today. The game did not require an update today. I attacked the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops on any stages, then I went after a couple small NPC islands, and 1 resource base.

I did not do any upgrades this week. I was not attacked since I last played, but a village was lost. Regardless, I won't be able to upgrade regardless, as I didn't have enough resources. I activated a second builder for free, but basically wasted it, as there is no way I can upgrade 2 buildings in 1 week at the current rate. I received 150 diamonds for free as a gift, and accidentally skipped over the traders Christmas message, something I was upset with myself for doing.

- I had a much longer session today. The game did not require an update today. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops on any stages.
- I went after several players and NPCs today to get wood and iron, as I really wanted to upgrade my Boom Cannon to level 15. Eventually, I decided that spending a little over 500 diamonds for this was justified, as I have wanted it for a really long time (multiple years) I considered saving up and doing it next week, but I feared someone would come and rob me in that time. I should level up to level 58 by next week.

- I continued power stone conversion again this week.
- I was not attacked since I last played (on my main island) however, I lost a couple of islands (the attacker had the clever username of `fire` which made it read `village lost to fire` it was funny, similar to that of the `Your village is being raided by God` message in Clash of Clans, but not as funny)

### Mega Crab

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

#### Beastly Mega Crab

I successfully destroyed the first 12 stages of the Beastly Mega crab, not losing troops until stage 11, where I lost 4 scorchers, and stage 12, where I lost 3 more scorchers. I made a bounty of loot from these attacks. - 2021 September 26th

I successfully destroyed the first 12 stages of the Beastly Mega crab, not losing troops until stage 10, where I lost 1 scorcher, stage 12, where I lost 2 scorchers, and stage 13, where I lost my last 5 scorchers. I made a bounty of loot from these attacks. - 2022 September 25th

I successfully destroyed the first 14 stages of the Beastly Mega crab, not losing troops until stage 12, where I lost 1 scorcher, stage 13, where I lost 1 more scorcher, stage 14, where I lost another scorcher, and stage 15, where I lost my last 5 scorchers. I gained a lot of resources from these attacks. - 2023, Sunday, October 22nd

#### Halloween Mega Crab

I successfully destroyed the first 14 stages of the Halloween Mega crab, not losing troops until stage 12, where I lost 2 scorchers, stage 13 where I lost 2 more scorchers, and stage 14 where I lost 3 more scorchers. I made a pretty good amount from the attacks. I like how the halloween mortars scare troops and make them act weird/go back/go back into the landing craft, etc. - 2021, Sunday, October 31st

I successfully destroyed the first 15 stages of the Halloween Mega crab, not losing troops until stage 11, where I lost 1 scorcher, stage 14 where I lost 4 more scorchers, and stage 15 where I lost the 3 more scorchers, but still won. I made a pretty good amount from the attacks.

I successfully destroyed the first 14 stages of the Halloween Mega crab, not losing troops until stage 11, where I lost 1 scorcher, and stage 14 where I lost 2 more scorchers. I made a pretty good amount from the attacks. There wasn't anything special this year, although I was able to quickly level bases due to increased troop speed, with several battles ending in 20 seconds or less. The Halloween mortars are a way to mix things up, and the cutouts of Dr. Terror. The explosions from these made it harder to play, as I continously was unable to easily tell if I had lost a scorcher or not, since the destruction of these cutouts has a similar effect. - 2023, Sunday, October 29th

#### Proto Mega Crab

I successfully destroyed the first 15 stages of the Proto Mega crab, not losing troops until stage 14, where I lost 4 scorchers. I made a pretty good amount from the attacks.

I did a few barrage, missile, and critter only attacks before I destroyed the rest of the base with my scorchers, destroying stage 14. - 2021 November 28th

I unlocked instant troop training for 1 day. Paired with the Mega Crab, and my overflowing gold stockpile, it extended the session. I attacked the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors island. I didn't attempt stage 5, as I wanted to go after the New Years mega crab. I spent over an hour attacking the mega crab, and split my session in 2, as my phone initially came close to dying. I got a trophy for defeating 20 stages of the mega crab, and due to instant troop training, I just kept spawning more scorchers, and throwing them into the mega crab until the base fell. I have never lost so many scorchers in one day. I made it to Mega Crab stage 22, I have never gotten this far before. I also found that attack attempts don't regenerate. - 2023, Sunday, January 1st

#### Hasty Mega Crab

I successfully destroyed the first 13 stages of the Beastly Mega crab, not losing troops until the last 4 stages, where I lost 7 scorchers. I am glad it was a hasty mega crab, so that I could get it over with. - 2022 Sunday, April 24th 

I continued the session during the car ride, where there was a brief Internet outage at one point. I attacked the first 20 stages of the hasty Mega Crab, not losing any troops until stage 15, where I lost 1 scorcher. I went on several bombing campaigns before attempting later stages. On stage 19, I lost 3 more scorchers. I received a trophy for finishing stage 19 of the Hasty Mega Crab. - 2023, Sunday, April 30th

#### Droid Turtle

I successfully destroyed the first 17 stages of the Droid Turtle today, not losing any troops until stage 17, where I lost 4 scorchers, and stage 18 (a suicide run) where I lost my last 4 scorchers in exchange for doing as much damage as possible to the base without a chance of success.

This event is new, yet it isn't mentioned in the `News` section, and is repeatedly referred to as the `Mega Crab` in multiple places. I earned a trophy for defeating the first 9 stages. This event was unexpected, and significantly extended my session, and split it in 2, as I ran too low on battery. - 2023, Sunday, May 28th

### 3D Touch issues

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

- While playing today, I constantly dealt with issues related to my posture of holding the device (which caused constant errors, and sporadic screengrabs) and the return of an annoying bug that made the game do nothing but zoom in and out with little control. The only fix is to turn the screen off, back on, quickly minimize the game, maximimize it, then quickly turn the screen off again, back on, quickly minimize the game again, and maximize it. It was so annoying. Sometimes it would start doing it again after the next screengrab. - 2021 November 28th
- There were no severe 3D touch issues today - 2021, Sunday, December 5th to 2021, Sunday, December 26th

- 3D touch issues were minimal today, but screenshot issues were through the roof. I find it idiotic that the power button on my device goes towards a voice "Assistant" that I don't use, rather than its actual purpose. Why not make a VA/Bixby button? While you are at it, why not make a screenshot button? You know, no VA button, virtual assistants don't need a button, a search assistant doesn't need a button. - 2022 January 30th to 2022 February 6th

### Warship

#### 2021, Sunday, August 1st, to 2021, Sunday, September 19th

I began building my warship a few weeks ago, and I didn't make any progress on it today, I am hoping the base doesn't reset each season, or else I won't continue doing this as much. I did not do any upgrades or any attacks.

- I did not do any player attacks today. I got attacked once since I last played. These attacks are always recent (within the past 167 hours) this one was less than 3 days ago, yet it doesn't let me view the replay. This attack was a major loss, with nearly 1 million wood, nearly 400000 iron, less than 100000 gold, and less than 100000 stone, a major loss. I can't ever see the replay, so I never know how they do it, but I always notice a similar pattern of troop layout. - 2022, Sunday, May 8th

- I did not do any player attacks yet again this week, but I got attacked twice since I last played, the first attack was unsuccessful, and the second attack was successful, but it wasn't much of a loss to me, as I didn't have very much wood, or stone on me, and I had far too much gold and iron. The attacker probably needed it more than I do, too bad you can't just donate resources to people. - 2022, Sunday, September 4th

- I did 3 player attacks this week, going after a couple small NPC islands, and 1 resource base.

#### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20. I am continuing the goal again, but I am likely to break it again. - As of July 25th 2021

### Excessive notifications

After the update on 2023, September 24th, the game has started to give notifications again. I have found them to be a bit excessive. - 2023, Sunday, October 1st
